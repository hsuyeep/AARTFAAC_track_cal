% Model efficacy is computed as the frobenius norm of the residual ACM after
% the ACM has been differenced.
% Values generated from:
% fid = fopen ('~/WORK/AARTFAAC/Reobs/11Jul12/LBA_OUTER_BAND_SPREAD/SB002_LBA_\
% OUTER_SPREAD_1ch.bin', 'rb'); as the norm (accsubAteam, 'fro'), after adding 
% bright sources in decreasing order of flux.
% Note that this particular dataset had only CasA and CygA visible among the 
% A-team sources. The remaining two sources were 410 and 230 Jy.
